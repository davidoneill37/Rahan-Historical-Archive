           <p>Legend has it that King Guaire was feasting in his castle after a sucessful hunt. It was nearly Easter, and St. Colman and his assistant were fasting for Lent and they were starving. As they sat praying in the woods, all the dishes from King Guaire's feast lifted off the table and flew all the way to St Colmans cave.</p>
           <p>The king and his servants looked high and low for the feast, but it was nowhere to be seen. He was furious. He stormed out of his castle, jumped on his horse and followed in persuit of the dishes.</p>
           <p>As Colman and his assistant prayed, Guaire's feast miraclously appeared before them. Finally, Guaire reached Colman's cave. To this day, you can see hoof prints in the rock.</p>
           <p>When at last King Guaire was let into the wood, he and St. Colman stood face to face. At that moment, he was no longer angry and the shook hands and embraced.</p>
