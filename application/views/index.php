        <p>Welcome to Rahan Historical Archive. Rahan is a rural area in the Irish midlands near Tullamore in Co. Offaly. Our aim is to bring the history and heritage of Rahan and it’s people back to life through the medium of this website. If you live here, if you have emigrated from here, if your ancestors have emigrated from here, or if you have an interest in the history of Rahan, this site is for you..</p>

    <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-4">
        <p>A special area of the site: The Children’s Page is dedicated to local school children and their teachers as a source of information about the heritage of the locality, presented in a child-friendly manner. It is intended that this will be a resource for history, geography and social projects. We want you to be able to access important elements of the heritage of Rahan and to feel part of that heritage. There is a concern that much historical material, memorabilia, articles and stories about the area and it’s people are in danger of being lost forever. We are endeavoring to preserve these for current Rahan natives, descendants of natives and for future generations..</p>
