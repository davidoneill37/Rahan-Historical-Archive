          <h2 class="pageheadings">The coming of Christianity to Rahan</h2>    
          <br>
           <p>St. Patrick brought christianity to Ireland in 432. Soon afterwards, monasteries were built all over Ireland and became hives of industry, learning and piety.</p>
           <p>Here in Rahan, it is probably true to say that the first organised settlement of life began with the arrival of two great christian leaders: firstly St. Colman and later St. Carthage. St. Colman building the great monastery of Lynally and St. Carthage building the great monastery of Rahan.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">St. Colman</h2>
          <br>
           <p>Colman’s parents were of noble race and from the Kingdom of Meath. He was a nephew of St. Colmcille – his mother Mor being Colmcilles sister. Colman was given a large area in the great wood of Fircall by Aedus, son of the Prince of Meath. Here Colman founded his monastery at what is now known as Lynally. The year was 590. Colman was to spend the next 20 years as Abbot over which time he would earn a reputation for sanctity and greatness. When Colman first arrived at Lynally, he was not welcome, but in time he had the full support of all. Some of his earliest followers were Cuinegan, Cuineda and Donncha and Maud, sons of the King of Fircall.</p>

           <br>
           <h2 class="pageheadings">St. Carthage</h2>
           <p>St. Carthage or Mochuda as he was mostly called, was born in what is now Co. Kerry. His father was a rich and powerful chieftain, but Carthage did not concern himself with earthly vanities and spent his youth as a swineherd near Castlemaine.</p>
           <p>It was while visiting Lynally that St. Colman recommended to him, that he found a monastery up the road at Rahan. So, saying farewell to Colman, Carthage along with 2 monks he had met enroute to Lynally, set out for the place indicated.</p>
           <p>St. Carthage founded the monastery of Rahan in 595 and soon had hundreds of disciples. He was later consecrated Abbot-Bishop of the district of Fircall. Carthage composed a poem of 580 lines for his monks known as ‘The Rule of St. Carthage’. It is one of the most interesting literary relics of the early christian church in Ireland. </p>
           <p>As many people know, Carthage and his monks were expelled from Rahan in the year 635, and there are varying accounts of the reason why.</p>
           <p>But during his time here, Ireland’s golden age of saints and scholars had shone very brightly here in Rahan. At one time it was one of the foremost schools in Ireland with monks and students numbering 1,000. In Rahan, we still celebrate St. Carthage’s Feast Day on the 16th of May every year.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">The Townlands of Rahan</h2>
           <p>As mentioned already, the parish of Rahan contains 60 townlands. Townlands generally correspond to ancient subdivisions of land often going back to gaelic times. Therefore, many of our townlands derive their names from the Irish language and the name of each townland tells a different story. For example: Kill, as in Killina, means a church, so obviously Killina has a long history of having a church; Derry as in Derrynanagh, Derryesker, or the Derries means an oak tree wood. Oak trees were held in very high regard in pre-christian times and were worshipped by the druids; Tulach is the Irish for hill. Tully of which the full name is Tullymorerahan means large hill of Rahan and overlooks Tullybeg, meaning a small hill! For the most part, the names of the townlands of Rahan are derived from the original Irish, but there are some exceptions. For example, Castletown, so called, because it once had a castle. Deerpark, is so called, because it once served as a park to contain deer for the nearby castle. Goldsmiths Lot, is so called, possibly, because a Lieutenant George Goldsmith received land here in payment for his part in Cromwell’s bloody campaign in Ireland between 1649 and 1652.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">The family Names of Rahan</h2>
           <p>As we have already said, Rahan people, down through the ages, have shown great resilience. Having come through wars, upheavals, famine, many of the family names still survive. In 1854, the most common surnames in Rahan were Molloy, Guynan, Fox, Cantwell, Grennan, Minnock , Dunne, Carroll, Corcoran and Daly. Today, most of those same families are still here.</p>
           <p>Cantwell’s trace their lineage way back to ... while there were Mooneys in Lynally back in the late 1600s. Corcorans have farmed in the same place at Aghadonagh for 5 generations. Members of many families went away at various points in our history and came back. Many more emigrated, never to return.</p>
           <p>Today, many of our community still have a strong connection with farming the land here. While most families were farmers in the 19th and 20th century, some were employed in places such as Goodbodys in Clara, the Jesuit College, the Presentation Convent, Rahan Lodge, Charleville Demesne or the Turf Development Board later known as Bord na Mona. Flax growing and potato growing were enterprises associated with Rahan in the past.</p>
           <p>Many families arrived in Rahan at defining moments in history - the Norman invasion, the Cromwellian plantations or to build roads in the early 20th century. Many came from all over Ireland and further afield to work on the building of the canal. Alan Lindley, who’s mother’s family have been lock-keepers at 30th lock can trace back his family 8 generations here. His ? first arrived here in 17? to work on the building of the canal and afterwards received the job of lock-keeper on the 30th lock. Others were drawn to Rahan by finding employment in brickmaking, carpentry, as blacksmiths or as tailors etc. A look at the Census for 1911, gives an indication of the different types of employment in the area at the time.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">The coming of the Canal</h2>
           <p>The Grand Canal connects Dublin with the River Shannon. It’s construction, which began in 1757, revolutionised transport in Ireland. In eighteenth century Ireland, road transport was still very rudimentary, so once built, the canal dominated passenger travel to and from Dublin. But just as importantly, it allowed for the speedier transportation of goods. For a rural area like Rahan, this new access to the capital city, would lead to many opportunities.</p>
           <p>The building of the Canal was fraught with many difficulties at the early stages, but in 1798, the Grand Canal finally reached Tullamore. Tullamore remained the canal’s terminus for six years. Then between 1801 and 1803, the canal was constructed through Rahan finally reaching the Shannon at Shannon Harbour in 1804.</p>
           <p>The building of the canal would have brought much activity to the area. Bridges had to built. In Rahan we have 5 Bridges over the canal: Corcoran’s Bridge, at Ballindrinan, Becan’s Bridge, Newtown, Henesy’s Bridge, at Goldsmith’s Lot, Ballincloghan Bridge at the 30th Lock and Cornalaur Bridge at the 31st Lock. A triple-arch aqueduct, also had to be constructed at Kilgortin, to carry the canal over the Clodiagh River.</p>
           <p>The Thatch Pub, at one time owned by the Corcoran family, was a station for the canal. At first, travel from here to Dublin would have taken about 15 hours. By 1834 the introduction of Fly Boats had cut the length of the journey to less than 10 hours - which was considerably shorter than the time required to complete the trip over land.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">Brickmaking</h2>
           <p>The canal brought many new industries with it and one of those was brickmaking. The clays found close to the canal were ideally suited to brickmaking. The canal provided a means of transporting the bricks by boat to waiting markets in Dublin or perhaps further afield. Bricks had many uses. They were used for drylining the insides of homes for the gentry and often for the erection of icehouses for preserving food. Brick was also an important material for building smoke funnels of lime-kilns.</p>
           <p>In the early stages, digging brickearth was tough, tiring work and a lot of help was needed. Often children worked alongside their parents. Wooden moulds were used for making bricks. The moulder was the name of the person who put the clay into the moulds. In 1837, there were 12 brickyards in the Pullough and Rahan areas. Each brickyard produced a little over 5,000 bricks per day. Boats could carry up to 25,000 bricks.</p>
           <p>In Rahan, brickmaking will be forever associated with names like Harney and Meehan and Healion.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">The Rahan Estate & Maria O’Brien</h2>
           <p>The beginning of the 19th century brought about great changes in Rahan starting firstly in 1801 with the coming of the canal and secondly in 1803 with the arrival of a Catholic Textile Merchant family from Dublin. Before this, Catholics could not acquire land, but now the O’Brien family were in a position to purchase over 4,000 acres which was part of the estate of the Marquis of Landsdowne, a descendent of Sir. William Petty, the Cromwellian surveyor.</p>
           <p>Denis Thomas O’Brien and his family were generous benefactors of the catholic church. The site of the chapel at Killina, which was built before 1817, was on their land and probably given by them to the parish. The present parochial house, built c. 1861, is also on what was O’Brien land. Denis Thomas O’Brien did something remarkable, he entrusted the Rahan Estate to his daughter, Miss Maria O’Brien.</p>
           <p>Maria O’Brien was a philanthropist. She was very keen to improve the lives of the children of the parish. At her own expense, she built a school at Killina and later invited the Presentation Sisters from Georges Hill, Dublin to take over the school which now had accommodation for a religious community. The convent was given three acres and a yearly income by Maria O’Brien. Children were educated free of charge and no child ever went hungry and any sick child was well looked after. The sisters received no financial reward for their work. It was some time before the sisters could afford to extend the premises but gradually as time went on classrooms were added. Subjects taught included the three R’s as well as cookery, laundry, needlecraft, drawing, singing, drill, industrial training and religion. From the very first day the school opened, there were over 100 children enrolled. She also gave land to Jesuits, on very generous terms for the building of the college at
            Tullabeg. 7 years after its foundation, Maria O’Brien herself entered the convent and became a nun taking the name Sr. Mary Clare. She died in 1827 and is buried in the church grounds.</p>
            <p>In the late 1860’s, the Rahan Estate passed into the possession of the Sherlock family who were related to the O’Briens. Eventually, it was owned by David Sherlock.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">The Presentation Sisters</h2>
           <p>Miss Maria O’Brien, who we have already spoken about, was a great champion of the poor children of the parish. Seeing the awful conditions that they endured, she built, at her own expense a school at Killina. After a while, she realised she could not continue on her own. She needed help. She invited the Presentation Sisters from Georges Hill, Dublin, to come and take over the school.</p>
           <p>It was thanks to the community of sisters in Rahan that the Presentation Mission in Madras began. One of their number, Rev. Mother Frances Xavier Curran along with a small group of nuns, set sail for Madras in 1841. After 5 months of high seas and rough gales, they arrived at their destination.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">The Jesuits at Tullabeg</h2>
           <p>The Jesuit Retreat House is a familiar building on the Rahan landscape. In its time it has been a school, a novitiate, a school of ecclesiastical studies, a retreat house and a nursing home. Nowadays there is a golf course in the grounds here. Many of us will remember priests and brothers who lived here. Fr. Coyne, Fr. Craig, Brother Guider, Brother Whittle. Many people from near and far would have called to the door here. Maybe to get a mass card signed or to see a priest. Many will remember when Fr. Hyde was here. People came maybe to talk about their troubles with him, to recieve his blessing, or to ask for his prayers. Many people came to mass here. This was a public church for many years. It was a central part of life for many from the surrounding locality. Though the main building is empty now, its walls hold a history that goes back to the early 19th century.</p>
           <p>The Jesuits, also known as the Society of Jesus, was founded by Ignatius of Loyola in 1539. They flourished for many centuries throughout the world. In 1814, Fr. Peter Kenny became the 1st superior of the Irish Mission of the Society. In that same year, he purchased Clongowes Wood and opened a college there. Then he looked at opening a Novitiate to cater for upper middle class Catholics. The bishop of Meath at the time, Dr. Patrick Joseph Plunkett gave his full support to the founding of Tullabeg house and school by the Jesuits.</p>
           <p>The remoteness of Tullybeg suited the recently restored society’s purposes as they wished to shun publicity. We must remember, it was the Penal times and, by law, such a society was not ment to exist in the country. Tullabeg gave them the seclusion they desired. At the time, Tullamore was but a small town and Philipstown or Daingean as we now know it, was the centre of commercial life in Offaly.</p>
           <p>Work began in early 1815 on the Jesuit College. In June 1818 it opened its doors to the first students. In 1930, and for the next 32 years, Tullybeg College became a School of Philosophy.</p>
           <p>Fr. Kevin Laheen, who was a Jesuit here in the 40’s has written 3 volumes on Tullabeg. Down through the years, Tullabeg also provided employment to many who came to live locally.</p>
           <p>In the 1940’s, the then Rector Donal O’Sullivan commissioned Evie Hone to design stained glass windows which for many years were situated in the community chapel. These windows were one of the glories of Irish religious art of the twentieth century. The influence of the Jesuits in Rahan stretches far and wide and they were held in high regard by the people of the locality.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">Education in Rahan</h2>
           <p>The very first schools in Rahan were possibly the schools at the monasteries of Lynally and Rahan. In more recent times there were Hedge Schools in Killina, Roscore, Killeranny, Clonshanny, Newtown, Cloonagh and Tullabeg. The name ‘Hedge School’ gives the impression of children being taught out in the open air, but in reality, classes were generally held in a building. The conditions of these buildings often left a lot to be desired, as a Board of Education Report of the 1830’s shows. Here we see a listing of the schools in Rahan at the time, who the teacher was, the ethos of the school, the condition of the building, and the numbers of pupils. Over time all of these Hedge schools faded away as a national educational system came into being.</p>
           <p>As we already know, the school in Killina, built by Ms. Maria O’Brien was run by the Presentation Sisters. Over time the school was extended to allow for growing numbers. In 1965, a brand new school was built in the convent grounds, to cater for both primary and secondary students. However, as in the past, the numbers of students soon outgrew the building. In the years that followed, there would be much additional building work.</p>
           <p>By 1936, there were 4 national schools in the parish. These schools were all catholic run. Church of Ireland children from the parish, either attended these schools or had to travel further afield to perhaps Liss, Clara or Tullamore.</p>
           <p>A model agricultural school was in operation in Rahan at the end of the last century. This would have been a forerunner of the agricultural colleges of the present day. The Island National School which had been established in 1849, closed permanently on the 20th of November, 1971. It’s 37 pupils and 2 teachers were transferred to Killina and Rahan National School at Newtown.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">Rahan at the beginning of the 20th Century</h2>
           <p>By the beginning of the 20th century, Ireland had already been under English control for over 700 years. Gradual change and paths towards freedom were well under way by the close of the 19th century. A defining moment in Irish history came about with the passing of the Home Rule Act. However, its implementation was suspended for the duration of WW1.</p>
           <p>The Easter Rising of 1916 brought our struggle for freedom back into the limelight. In 1920 and as fear of revolution escalated, the government at Westminster, unwilling to negotiate with the Irish, sent over its new volunteer police force, who, because of their improvised uniforms, became known in Ireland as the Black ‘n Tans.</p>
           <p>In the early 1930’s, the Irish Government under De Valera made a decision to refuse to pay the ‘land annuities’ to Britain. These were the repayments on the loans granted by Britain to Irish Tenant farmers to enable them to purchase their own land. Thereafter followed an economic war, known as The Anglo-Irish Trade War with Britain which lead to hardship for many Irish rural communities, and Rahan was no different than any other.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">Blacksmiths</h2>
           <p>Blacksmiths were a very important part of rural Ireland right up until the latter end of the 20th century. Every locality had its own Blacksmith. In Rahan, we will remember names such as Connolly and O’Rourke. Their highly skilled work included agricultural implements, gates, tools and horse shoes forged from wrought iron. John O’Rourke was born in 1918. He started working in his father’s forge in his early teens. Being a Blacksmith was very hard work. John tells us a little bit about the daily workload.</p>
            <p>John believes not everyone can be a Blacksmith. It has to be in you. Being a Blacksmith requires great patience and you have to be able to withstand the great heat in the forge.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">The coming of Electricity to Rahan</h2>
           <p>Possibly, the greatest innovation of all in the early days of the 20th century was the arrival of electricity. It’s hard for us to imagine now just how difficult life was before this.</p>
           <p>In 1929, the Shannon Hydrolectric Scheme, which harnessed power from the river Shannon to produce electricity, was completed. The Scheme had taken 4,000 men 4 years to complete and had cost 10 million pounds.</p>
           <p>The roll out of electricity to every part of the countryside under the Rural Electrification Scheme began in 1946. It was still to be some time before it would arrive in Rahan.</p>
           <p>Though rural electrification didn’t come to Rahan until 1961, there were enterprising people who did have power of some kind! But it would be a while before people would have the mod-cons we take for granted today.</p>

           <p>One of the greatest events of the 20th century was an event which took place in 1932 when the 31st International Eucharistic Congress was held in Dublin. The congress was also the occasion of the 1,500th anniversary of St. Patrick’s arrival in Ireland and was very much a spiritual event.</p>
           <p>It was an extraordinary undertaking for a small country just getting on its feet. 12 ocean liners and a number of other ships brought both religious and lay people from all over the world. A new radio station was built in Athlone to broadcast the congress all across Europe. On the last day of the Congress, a Solemn Pontifical High Mass was held in the Phoenix Park attended, it has been said, by approximately a quarter of the population of Ireland. Nan Higgins was 19 years of age when she attended the Congress.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">Rationing</h2>
           <p>Cars were a rarity in rural Ireland of the early 20th century. Often only the local priest and doctor had one. During the war years, petrol was rationed, so, it wasn’t until the fifties really, that cars began to appear on our country roads.</p>
           <p>Rationing was a fact of life in the 1940s. The war was on and scarcity was everywhere. As mentioned already, those with cars suffered the inconvenience of having no petrol and many cars remained parked in sheds. But that was mild in comparison to controls of food which were very severe, even if everyone’s recollection may not be the same.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">Emigration</h2>
           <p>Down through the ages, emigration has been a fact of life in Ireland, and Rahan was no different than anywhere else. During famine times, many people emigrated from Rahan to places like England, Australia and America, often never to return.</p>
           <p>There was a common thing called ‘chain migration’. This was where some of the family emigrated first. Money was sent back to pay passage for other family members. Then, in dribs and drabs, they went.</p>
           <p>Many people from Rahan emigrated before and after the famine of 1847. Many more would follow in the years ahead. About 1848, Mary Sheridan from Rahan, emigrated along with her husband Martin Digan and children to Wisconsin in America. But Mary never forgot her roots and often spoke to her children and grandchildren about a place called Rahan. Over 163 years later, here great, great, great grandson, Mark Sobie was able to re-establish links with that place called Rahan, that he had heard so much about as a child.</p>

           <p>Maggie Molloy, emigrated to New York, in 1904 along with her sister, At the end of April, 1915, she received word that her father, back in Roscore was very ill. Maggie decided to go home straight away, by the quickest route, to be with him. We will remember that this was during WW1. At the time the RMS Lusitania, a British Liner belonging to the Cunard Line Company was the largest and fastest steamer in the Atlantic fleet. On Saturday 1st May 1915, just after 12pm, she left New York with over 1,900 passengers and crew, on board. Among them was Maggie Molloy from Roscore.</p>
           <p>On the 7th May, as the ship was just off the coast of Ireland, it was torpedoed by a German u-boat. The ship took just 18 minutes to sink. This event would later change the course of the War. About 764 people were saved, but Maggie Molloy was not one of them.</p>
           <p>The sinking provoked outrage and there were many protests in the US. Some well known American socialites had also perished on board as well as our own Sir Hugh Lane. There had been warnings by the German Embassy in newspapers about the dangers of sailing during the war. There had even been an anonymous warning just before the ship sailed but this had not been a deterrent. For the Molloy family, this was a double tragedy as Maggie’s father had passed away, unknown to her, while she was actually making her way to the boat.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">Rambling & other pastimes</h2>
            <p>In early 20th century Rahan, people had to work very hard to earn a living. Before mechanisation, all work was done by hand. Despite life being difficult and maybe even because of this, people still found time for respite from the daily struggle.</p>
            <p>One custom which has all but died out now was the custom in the evenings of Rambling. Rambling was the practice of friends and neighbours convening in the evenings at a designated house in the locality to while away a few hours storytelling, or discussing current affairs, or maybe playing cards. Sometimes there would be a bit of music played also. One game which was often played, maybe at a crossroads was the game of pitch and toss. Though he never got a chance to play it himself, Robert Cahill as a young boy remembers seeing men playing it.</p>

            <p>The late 40’s and early 50’s were times of many changes in Ireland. Things were becoming less strict. There was a growing awareness, or some might say a revival, of our culture. In 1952 a branch of Comhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann was founded in Rahan. Dan Cleary from Ballinamere, founded Comhaltas in Rahan along with a group of talented local musicians. There had been a meeting in Mullingar about reviving the playing of the Uilleann Pipes. This led Dan to the idea of helping the revival of all forms of traditional music.</p>

           <h2 class="pageheadings">The GAA in Rahan</h2>
           <br>
            <p>Another organisation which prompted our culture was the GAA. The history of the GAA in Rahan goes back a long way. The first title to come to Rahan was in 1928 when they beat Coolderry in the Junior Hurling Final. That same team went on to win the Intermediate Hurling Final of 1930. Rahan got to the Senior Final in 1936 but failed to take the title from a super Tullamore team. There followed a few years in the wilderness, but the Intermediate County Final of 1948 is one which stands out in the memory.</p>
